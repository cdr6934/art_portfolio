Along the black sands, awaits the sun to bring forth the light to all and everyone. After staying overnight in our vehicle; we got up bright and early in order to catch the sun before it rose. It gave us the ability to take a wonderful early morning shot with blue skies. Even though the entire night was full of clouds.
