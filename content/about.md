## About Me 
Half software engineer, half digital Picasso, and a sprinkle of world explorer. Sure, he's got a Master's in Data Science, but that doesn't stop him from daydreaming of generative art during those endless data meetings. When he's not making computers sing or turning algorithms into art, Chris is probably lost in a book, plotting his next globetrotting adventure, or trying a new "creative medium" (which last time meant macramé – don't ask). Want a peek into the quirky intersection of his tech-brain and art-heart? Pop over to [Substack](generative.substack.com).
